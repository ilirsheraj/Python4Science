       "\"00:00:00.760 00:00:05.080 I'm now going to give you two more example problems of computing.\\n00:00:05.080 00:00:09.310 eigendecomposition of matrices by hand.\\n00:00:09.310 00:00:14.860 Obviously this is on the computer but I encourage you to do these problems by hand and they're not done\\n00:00:14.860 00:00:15.520 in Matlab.\\n00:00:15.520 00:00:19.270 So I guess that's what it means by hand.\\n00:00:19.270 00:00:20.530 So let's get started.\\n00:00:20.560 00:00:28.030 Here is a two by two matrix and you should pause the video go through find the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors\\n00:00:28.060 00:00:37.120 of this matrix so the way we start is by shifting the matrix by Lambda so subtracting lambda from the\\n00:00:37.120 00:00:44.260 diagonal elements setting the determinant equal to zero and then proceeding to compute the determinant\\n00:00:44.290 00:00:48.820 which is also called the characteristic equation of this matrix.\\n00:00:48.850 00:00:57.730 So that works out to be three minus lambda times six minus lambda minus four equals zero and then expanding\\n00:00:57.760 00:01:04.600 these two terms multiplying out these two terms and then collecting the like terms gives us lambda squared\\n00:01:04.960 00:01:13.930 minus nine lambda plus fourteen equals zero and then this expression here can be factored into lambda\\n00:01:14.020 00:01:22.150 minus seven and Lambda minus two and now it's pretty easy to see that the two lambdas that will solve\\n00:01:22.150 00:01:24.280 this equation that solve this equation.\\n00:01:24.280 00:01:30.910 In other words the two eigenvalues of this matrix are plus 7 and plus two.\\n00:01:30.910 00:01:37.180 So that was step one we found the eigenvalues of this matrix and now we go through for each of these\\n00:01:37.180 00:01:45.160 eigenvalues shift the matrix by that amount by that value and then figure out what is a vector in the\\n00:01:45.280 00:01:48.410 shifted matrices null space.\\n00:01:48.630 00:01:50.530 OK so let's start with 2.\\n00:01:50.580 00:01:53.610 So this gives us the matrix 1 1 4 4.\\n00:01:53.610 00:02:00.360 And now we want to find the missing vector here and you've probably guessed it already it is 1 minus\\n00:02:00.360 00:02:01.470 1.\\n00:02:01.590 00:02:09.330 And of course you know that also acceptable would be minus 1 1 or minus quadrillion plus quadrillion.\\n00:02:09.570 00:02:17.130 This vector simply identifies a subspace for the null space of this shifted matrix in any vector that's\\n00:02:17.250 00:02:23.520 in that null space is perfectly fine as an eigenvector.\\n00:02:23.520 00:02:31.860 Now that said the best choice for an eigenvector would be a vector that has a norm of 1 a magnitude\\n00:02:31.860 00:02:32.710 of 1.\\n00:02:32.940 00:02:39.270 And the second best choice would be integer values that are easy to interpret and compact to write like\\n00:02:39.270 00:02:40.230 this.\\n00:02:40.230 00:02:40.500 All right.\\n00:02:40.520 00:02:41.730 So this was for two.\\n00:02:41.730 00:02:49.350 Now we go to the second eigenvalues which was seven and that gives us this matrix minus 4 1 and 4 minus\\n00:02:49.350 00:02:50.300 1.\\n00:02:50.370 00:02:57.210 And here a vector that could work as an eigenvector as a basis for the null space of this shifted matrix\\n00:02:57.300 00:02:59.790 is the numbers 1 4.\\n00:02:59.820 00:03:06.690 So here is the big picture overview we have this matrix and here you see the eigenvalue and its corresponding\\n00:03:06.690 00:03:12.010 eigenvector and the other eigenvalue and the other corresponding eigenvector.\\n00:03:12.060 00:03:14.080 Now your results will be correct.\\n00:03:14.190 00:03:21.960 If you have the correct pairing of eigenvalue and any multiple any scaled version of this vector; it\\n00:03:21.960 00:03:28.860 doesn't matter if you call this lambda one and this V one that's fine because there's no intrinsic ordering.\\n00:03:28.860 00:03:32.250 What matters is that you have the pairing correct.\\n00:03:32.250 00:03:32.470 All right.\\n00:03:32.490 00:03:34.310 So that was the two by two case.\\n00:03:34.380 00:03:37.080 Now let's go for a three by three case.\\n00:03:37.080 00:03:40.160 This one is a little bit more challenging and I have to admit.\\n00:03:40.200 00:03:45.660 So I first came up with these numbers and then I started computing the eigendecomposition.\\n00:03:45.660 00:03:50.480 Now I have to admit that I got stuck on one of the eigenvectors.\\n00:03:50.670 00:03:52.400 I couldn't quite figure it out on my own.\\n00:03:52.430 00:03:54.390 So I used Matlab to compute that\\n00:03:54.390 00:03:55.200 eigenvector.\\n00:03:55.500 00:04:04.490 So what I encourage you to do is find all three eigenvalues by hand and I think it will be pretty obvious\\n00:04:04.490 00:04:08.390 when you start working through it which is the difficult eigenvalue.\\n00:04:08.390 00:04:15.530 So then what you should do by hand is find two of the eigenvectors that you can get basically just by\\n00:04:15.800 00:04:18.920 kind of eyeballing and making some educated guesses.\\n00:04:18.920 00:04:24.860 And then the third eigenvector you can use a computer to solve or you can just wait and watch me come\\n00:04:24.860 00:04:26.660 up with a solution.\\n00:04:26.850 00:04:27.090 All right.\\n00:04:27.120 00:04:34.590 So again we start by shifting this matrix by minus lambda setting the determinant equal to zero and\\n00:04:34.590 00:04:40.770 then proceeding to compute the determinant of this equation and altogether that gives us the characteristic\\n00:04:40.830 00:04:43.560 equation of this matrix.\\n00:04:43.560 00:04:45.270 Now this is a little bit longer.\\n00:04:45.270 00:04:50.820 It's a little bit trickier the arithmetic gets a little bit hairy in particular you end up with this\\n00:04:50.910 00:04:59.240 minus lambda cubed term as well as a couple of multiple terms with Lambda and Lambda squared.\\n00:04:59.250 00:05:05.490 Now once you collect all of these like terms you'll end up with an expression that looks like this.\\n00:05:05.520 00:05:15.240 So it should be minus lambda cubed plus 10 times lambda squared plus eleven lambda equals zero Now something\\n00:05:15.270 00:05:22.030 interesting has happened here all of these terms have a lambda attached to them which means that we\\n00:05:22.030 00:05:29.950 can take a lambda out of each of these terms and rewrite this expression as minus lambda times.\\n00:05:29.980 00:05:36.160 All of this stuff and immediately that tells us that lambda equals zero is a solution.\\n00:05:36.160 00:05:43.030 So when you set this lambda to be zero it doesn't actually matter what's inside this parenthetical statement\\n00:05:43.360 00:05:47.390 that's immediately going to set to make this equation true.\\n00:05:47.440 00:05:55.300 That means that one of the eigenvalues of this matrix is zero and I'm going to have an entire video\\n00:05:55.330 00:05:59.140 just about this phenomenon a little bit later in this section.\\n00:05:59.140 00:06:03.550 But essentially when an eigenvector is an eigenvalue is zero.\\n00:06:03.730 00:06:10.360 It means that the matrix is singular and that you can actually see by looking at this matrix and you\\n00:06:10.360 00:06:19.080 see that column 1 plus column 2 equals column 3 so whenever you have a singular matrix at least one\\n00:06:19.140 00:06:22.110 eigenvalues value is going to be equal to zero.\\n00:06:22.170 00:06:30.450 And in fact the number of eigenvalues that are equal to zero tells you about the rank of this matrix.\\n00:06:30.490 00:06:33.870 More on that in the later video.\\n00:06:33.880 00:06:39.160 Now once you've gotten to this step you can further factor this equation and you end up with the result\\n00:06:39.160 00:06:44.360 that lambda equals zero lambda equals minus 1 and Lambda equals eleven.\\n00:06:44.590 00:06:50.110 So you can probably guess that this is going to be the tricky I can value to compute the corresponding\\n00:06:50.110 00:06:55.600 I can vector of and this is the one that I got a little bit stuck with.\\n00:06:55.600 00:06:57.490 And so I used Matlab as a crutch.\\n00:06:57.490 00:06:58.540 I cheated a little bit.\\n00:06:59.250 00:07:01.500 OK so but let's go through all of these.\\n00:07:01.840 00:07:07.840 So we start with zero and now this is kind of a funny thing because we are shifting the matrix by zero\\n00:07:08.200 00:07:10.970 which actually means we're not changing the matrix at all.\\n00:07:11.140 00:07:21.000 And that means that this matrix A already has a non-trivial null space even without doing any shifting.\\n00:07:21.130 00:07:28.010 So this problem actually boils down to finding a vector in the null space or a basis for the null space.\\n00:07:28.270 00:07:35.380 Even without doing any shifting so based on what I just told you about how do I set up this matrix that\\n00:07:35.660 00:07:42.950 column one plus column two equals column three a basis for the null space is 1 one minus 1.\\n00:07:42.970 00:07:49.130 So you can try for each of these rows the first column plus the second column minus the third column\\n00:07:49.220 00:07:52.090 equals zero all right.\\n00:07:52.100 00:07:53.270 So now let's move on.\\n00:07:53.270 00:07:59.350 So now we shift this matrix by eleven and this is basically where I got stuck and switch to matlab.\\n00:07:59.360 00:08:04.570 So it turns out that eigenvector is nineteen forty one and thirty six.\\n00:08:04.580 00:08:10.430 So if you figured out this I can vector on your own without using a computer then good for you you are\\n00:08:10.460 00:08:14.960 a better or at least more patient mathematician than I am.\\n00:08:15.200 00:08:19.210 And then we get to the third eigenvalue which was minus one.\\n00:08:19.220 00:08:21.130 So now that becomes plus one.\\n00:08:21.230 00:08:26.390 And here is that shifted matrix and this one you should be able to solve on your own.\\n00:08:26.480 00:08:28.810 In fact it's even easier than it looks.\\n00:08:28.820 00:08:35.930 And if you need a hint before I show the answer then the hint is just consider that this third column\\n00:08:36.020 00:08:42.340 is actually pretty useless if you get rid of this third column it becomes really easy to find the \\n00:08:42.380 00:08:46.520 eigenvector in this shifted matrices null space.\\n00:08:46.790 00:08:52.400 So in fact it's one minus one and then zero you just set the third element to be zero.\\n00:08:52.670 00:08:59.810 So that leads us to the big picture overview of the eigendecomposition of this three by three singular\\n00:08:59.810 00:09:06.130 matrix rank 2 matrix we have eigenvalues 0 minus 11 and minus 1.\\n00:09:06.200 00:09:09.200 And these are the corresponding eigenvectors.\\n00:09:09.200 00:09:12.430 And notice I've written them as row vectors and then transpose.\\n00:09:12.430 00:09:19.160 So these are still column vectors we generally always think about eigenvectors as column vectors and\\n00:09:19.160 00:09:25.640 you will learn more about why that is the case in the video on diagonalization, which is coming up soon.\""

eigenvector as a basis for the null space of this shifted matrix00:02:57.300 00:02:59.790 is the numbers 1 4.00:02:59.820 00:03:06.690 So here is the big picture overview we have this matrix and here you see the eigenvalue and its corresponding00:03:06.690 00:03:12.010 eigenvector and the other eigenvalue and the other corresponding eigenvector.00:03:12.060 00:03:14.080 Now your results will be correct.00:03:14.190 00:03:21.960 If you have the correct pairing of eigenvalue and any multiple any scaled version of this vector; it00:03:21.960 00:03:28.860 doesn't matter if you call this lambda one and this V one that's fine because there's no intrinsic ordering.00:03:28.860 00:03:32.250 What matters is that you have the pairing correct.00:03:32.250 00:03:32.470 All right.00:03:32.490 00:03:34.310 So that was the two by two case.00:03:34.380 00:03:37.080 Now let's go for a three by three case.00:03:37.080 00:03:40.160 This one is a little bit more challenging and I have to admit.00:03:40.200 00:03:45.660 So I first came up with these numbers and then I started computing the eigendecomposition.00:03:45.660 00:03:50.480 Now I have to admit that I got stuck on one of the eigenvectors.00:03:50.670 00:03:52.400 I couldn't quite figure it out on my own.00:03:52.430 00:03:54.390 So I used Matlab to compute that00:03:54.390 00:03:55.200 eigenvector.00:03:55.500 00:04:04.490 So what I encourage you to do is find all three eigenvalues by hand and I think it will be pretty obvious00:04:04.490 00:04:08.390 when you start working through it which is the difficult eigenvalue.00:04:08.390 00:04:15.530 So then what you should do by hand is find two of the eigenvectors that you can get basically just by00:04:15.800 00:04:18.920 kind of eyeballing and making some educated guesses.00:04:18.920 00:04:24.860 And then the third eigenvector you can use a computer to solve or you can just wait and watch me come00:04:24.860 00:04:26.660 up with a solution.00:04:26.850 00:04:27.090 All right.00:04:27.120 00:04:34.590 So again we start by shifting this matrix by minus lambda setting the determinant equal to zero and00:04:34.590 00:04:40.770 then proceeding to compute the determinant of this equation and altogether that gives us the characteristic00:04:40.830 00:04:43.560 equation of this matrix.00:04:43.560 00:04:45.270 Now this is a little bit longer.00:04:45.270 00:04:50.820 It's a little bit trickier the arithmetic gets a little bit hairy in particular you end up with this00:04:50.910 00:04:59.240 minus lambda cubed term as well as a couple of multiple terms with Lambda and Lambda squared.00:04:59.250 00:05:05.490 Now once you collect all of these like terms you'll end up with an expression that looks like this.00:05:05.520 00:05:15.240 So it should be minus lambda cubed plus 10 times lambda squared plus eleven lambda equals zero Now something00:05:15.270 00:05:22.030 interesting has happened here all of these terms have a lambda attached to them which means that we00:05:22.030 00:05:29.950 can take a lambda out of each of these terms and rewrite this expression as minus lambda times.00:05:29.980 00:05:36.160 All of this stuff and immediately that tells us that lambda equals zero is a solution.00:05:36.160 00:05:43.030 So when you set this lambda to be zero it doesn't actually matter what's inside this parenthetical statement00:05:43.360 00:05:47.390 that's immediately going to set to make this equation true.00:05:47.440 00:05:55.300 That means that one of the eigenvalues of this matrix is zero and I'm going to have an entire video00:05:55.330 00:05:59.140 just about this phenomenon a little bit later in this section.00:05:59.140 00:06:03.550 But essentially when an eigenvector is an eigenvalue is zero.00:06:03.730 00:06:10.360 It means that the matrix is singular and that you can actually see by looking at this matrix and you00:06:10.360 00:06:19.080 see that column 1 plus column 2 equals column 3 so whenever you have a singular matrix at least one00:06:19.140 00:06:22.110 eigenvalues value is going to be equal to zero.00:06:22.170 00:06:30.450 And in fact the number of eigenvalues that are equal to zero tells you about the rank of this matrix.00:06:30.490 00:06:33.870 More on that in the later video.00:06:33.880 00:06:39.160 Now once you've gotten to this step you can further factor this equation and you end up with the result00:06:39.160 00:06:44.360 that lambda equals zero lambda equals minus 1 and Lambda equals eleven.00:06:44.590 00:06:50.110 So you can probably guess that this is going to be the tricky I can value to compute the corresponding00:06:50.110 00:06:55.600 I can vector of and this is the one that I got a little bit stuck with.00:06:55.600 00:06:57.490 And so I used Matlab as a crutch.00:06:57.490 00:06:58.540 I cheated a little bit.00:06:59.250 00:07:01.500 OK so but let's go through all of these.00:07:01.840 00:07:07.840 So we start with zero and now this is kind of a funny thing because we are shifting the matrix by zero00:07:08.200 00:07:10.970 which actually means we're not changing the matrix at all.00:07:11.140 00:07:21.000 And that means that this matrix A already has a non-trivial null space even without doing any shifting.00:07:21.130 00:07:28.010 So this problem actually boils down to finding a vector in the null space or a basis for the null space.00:07:28.270 00:07:35.380 Even without doing any shifting so based on what I just told you about how do I set up this matrix that00:07:35.660 00:07:42.950 column one plus column two equals column three a basis for the null space is 1 one minus 1.00:07:42.970 00:07:49.130 So you can try for each of these rows the first column plus the second column minus the third column00:07:49.220 00:07:52.090 equals zero all right.00:07:52.100 00:07:53.270 So now let's move on.00:07:53.270 00:07:59.350 So now we shift this matrix by eleven and this is basically where I got stuck and switch to matlab.00:07:59.360 00:08:04.570 So it turns out that eigenvector is nineteen forty one and thirty six.00:08:04.580 00:08:10.430 So if you figured out this I can vector on your own without using a computer then good for you you are00:08:10.460 00:08:14.960 a better or at least more patient mathematician than I am.00:08:15.200 00:08:19.210 And then we get to the third eigenvalue which was minus one.00:08:19.220 00:08:21.130 So now that becomes plus one.00:08:21.230 00:08:26.390 And here is that shifted matrix and this one you should be able to solve on your own.00:08:26.480 00:08:28.810 In fact it's even easier than it looks.00:08:28.820 00:08:35.930 And if you need a hint before I show the answer then the hint is just consider that this third column00:08:36.020 00:08:42.340 is actually pretty useless if you get rid of this third column it becomes really easy to find the 00:08:42.380 00:08:46.520 eigenvector in this shifted matrices null space.00:08:46.790 00:08:52.400 So in fact it's one minus one and then zero you just set the third element to be zero.00:08:52.670 00:08:59.810 So that leads us to the big picture overview of the eigendecomposition of this three by three singular00:08:59.810 00:09:06.130 matrix rank 2 matrix we have eigenvalues 0 minus 11 and minus 1.00:09:06.200 00:09:09.200 And these are the corresponding eigenvectors.00:09:09.200 00:09:12.430 And notice I've written them as row vectors and then transpose.00:09:12.430 00:09:19.160 So these are still column vectors we generally always think about eigenvectors as column vectors and00:09:19.160 00:09:25.640 you will learn more about why that is the case in the video on diagonalization, which is coming up soon.\""

       "\"I'm now going to give you two more example problems of computing. eigendecomposition of matrices by hand. Obviously this is on the computer but I encourage you to do these problems by hand and they're not done in Matlab. So I guess that's what it means by hand. So let's get started. Here is a two by two matrix and you should pause the video go through find the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of this matrix so the way we start is by shifting the matrix by Lambda so subtracting lambda from the diagonal elements setting the determinant equal to zero and then proceeding to compute the determinant which is also called the characteristic equation of this matrix. So that works out to be three minus lambda times six minus lambda minus four equals zero and then expanding these two terms multiplying out these two terms and then collecting the like terms gives us lambda squared minus nine lambda plus fourteen equals zero and then this expression here can be factored into lambda minus seven and Lambda minus two and now it's pretty easy to see that the two lambdas that will solve this equation that solve this equation. In other words the two eigenvalues of this matrix are plus 7 and plus two. So that was step one we found the eigenvalues of this matrix and now we go through for each of these eigenvalues shift the matrix by that amount by that value and then figure out what is a vector in the shifted matrices null space. OK so let's start with 2. So this gives us the matrix 1 1 4 4. And now we want to find the missing vector here and you've probably guessed it already it is 1 minus 1. And of course you know that also acceptable would be minus 1 1 or minus quadrillion plus quadrillion. This vector simply identifies a subspace for the null space of this shifted matrix in any vector that's in that null space is perfectly fine as an eigenvector. Now that said the best choice for an eigenvector would be a vector that has a norm of 1 a magnitude of 1. And the second best choice would be integer values that are easy to interpret and compact to write like this. All right. So this was for two. Now we go to the second eigenvalues which was seven and that gives us this matrix minus 4 1 and 4 minus 1. And here a vector that could work as an eigenvector as a basis for the null space of this shifted matrix is the numbers 1 4. So here is the big picture overview we have this matrix and here you see the eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector and the other eigenvalue and the other corresponding eigenvector. Now your results will be correct. If you have the correct pairing of eigenvalue and any multiple any scaled version of this vector; it doesn't matter if you call this lambda one and this V one that's fine because there's no intrinsic ordering. What matters is that you have the pairing correct. All right. So that was the two by two case. Now let's go for a three by three case. This one is a little bit more challenging and I have to admit. So I first came up with these numbers and then I started computing the eigendecomposition. Now I have to admit that I got stuck on one of the eigenvectors. I couldn't quite figure it out on my own. So I used Matlab to compute that eigenvector. So what I encourage you to do is find all three eigenvalues by hand and I think it will be pretty obvious when you start working through it which is the difficult eigenvalue. So then what you should do by hand is find two of the eigenvectors that you can get basically just by kind of eyeballing and making some educated guesses. And then the third eigenvector you can use a computer to solve or you can just wait and watch me come up with a solution. All right. So again we start by shifting this matrix by minus lambda setting the determinant equal to zero and then proceeding to compute the determinant of this equation and altogether that gives us the characteristic equation of this matrix. Now this is a little bit longer. It's a little bit trickier the arithmetic gets a little bit hairy in particular you end up with this minus lambda cubed term as well as a couple of multiple terms with Lambda and Lambda squared. Now once you collect all of these like terms you'll end up with an expression that looks like this. So it should be minus lambda cubed plus 10 times lambda squared plus eleven lambda equals zero Now something interesting has happened here all of these terms have a lambda attached to them which means that we can take a lambda out of each of these terms and rewrite this expression as minus lambda times. All of this stuff and immediately that tells us that lambda equals zero is a solution. So when you set this lambda to be zero it doesn't actually matter what's inside this parenthetical statement that's immediately going to set to make this equation true. That means that one of the eigenvalues of this matrix is zero and I'm going to have an entire video just about this phenomenon a little bit later in this section. But essentially when an eigenvector is an eigenvalue is zero. It means that the matrix is singular and that you can actually see by looking at this matrix and you see that column 1 plus column 2 equals column 3 so whenever you have a singular matrix at least one eigenvalues value is going to be equal to zero. And in fact the number of eigenvalues that are equal to zero tells you about the rank of this matrix. More on that in the later video. Now once you've gotten to this step you can further factor this equation and you end up with the result that lambda equals zero lambda equals minus 1 and Lambda equals eleven. So you can probably guess that this is going to be the tricky I can value to compute the corresponding I can vector of and this is the one that I got a little bit stuck with. And so I used Matlab as a crutch. I cheated a little bit. OK so but let's go through all of these. So we start with zero and now this is kind of a funny thing because we are shifting the matrix by zero which actually means we're not changing the matrix at all. And that means that this matrix A already has a non-trivial null space even without doing any shifting. So this problem actually boils down to finding a vector in the null space or a basis for the null space. Even without doing any shifting so based on what I just told you about how do I set up this matrix that column one plus column two equals column three a basis for the null space is 1 one minus 1. So you can try for each of these rows the first column plus the second column minus the third column equals zero all right. So now let's move on. So now we shift this matrix by eleven and this is basically where I got stuck and switch to matlab. So it turns out that eigenvector is nineteen forty one and thirty six. So if you figured out this I can vector on your own without using a computer then good for you you are a better or at least more patient mathematician than I am. And then we get to the third eigenvalue which was minus one. So now that becomes plus one. And here is that shifted matrix and this one you should be able to solve on your own. In fact it's even easier than it looks. And if you need a hint before I show the answer then the hint is just consider that this third column is actually pretty useless if you get rid of this third column it becomes really easy to find the  eigenvector in this shifted matrices null space. So in fact it's one minus one and then zero you just set the third element to be zero. So that leads us to the big picture overview of the eigendecomposition of this three by three singular matrix rank 2 matrix we have eigenvalues 0 minus 11 and minus 1. And these are the corresponding eigenvectors. And notice I've written them as row vectors and then transpose. So these are still column vectors we generally always think about eigenvectors as column vectors and you will learn more about why that is the case in the video on diagonalization, which is coming up soon.\""

       "\"I'm now going to g*** you two m*** example problems of computing. eigendecomposition of matrices by hand. Obviously t*** is on the computer but I encourage you to do these problems by h*** and they're not d*** in Matlab. So I guess that's w*** it means by hand. So let's get started. H*** is a two by two matrix and you should pause the video go through f*** the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of t*** matrix so the way we start is by shifting the matrix by Lambda so subtracting lambda f*** the diagonal elements setting the determinant equal to z*** and t*** proceeding to compute the determinant which is a*** called the characteristic equation of t*** matrix. So t*** works out to be three minus lambda times six minus lambda minus f*** equals z*** and t*** expanding these two terms multiplying out these two terms and t*** collecting the l*** terms gives us lambda squared minus n*** lambda p*** fourteen equals z*** and t*** t*** expression h*** can be factored i*** lambda minus seven and Lambda minus two and now i*** pretty e*** to see t*** the two lambdas t*** w*** solve t*** equation t*** solve t*** equation. In other words the two eigenvalues of t*** matrix are p*** 7 and p*** two. So t*** was s*** one we found the eigenvalues of t*** matrix and now we go through for e*** of these eigenvalues shift the matrix by t*** amount by t*** value and t*** figure out w*** is a vector in the shifted matrices n*** space. OK so let's start w*** 2. So t*** gives us the matrix 1 1 4 4. And now we w*** to f*** the missing vector h*** and you've probably guessed it already it is 1 minus 1. And of course you k*** t*** a*** acceptable would be minus 1 1 or minus quadrillion p*** quadrillion. T*** vector simply identifies a subspace for the n*** space of t*** shifted matrix in any vector that's in t*** n*** space is perfectly f*** as an eigenvector. Now t*** s*** the b*** choice for an eigenvector would be a vector t*** has a n*** of 1 a magnitude of 1. And the second b*** choice would be integer values t*** are e*** to interpret and compact to write l*** this. All right. So t*** was for two. Now we go to the second eigenvalues which was seven and t*** gives us t*** matrix minus 4 1 and 4 minus 1. And h*** a vector t*** could w*** as an eigenvector as a basis for the n*** space of t*** shifted matrix is the numbers 1 4. So h*** is the big picture overview we h*** t*** matrix and h*** you see the eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector and the other eigenvalue and the other corresponding eigenvector. Now y*** results w*** be correct. If you h*** the correct pairing of eigenvalue and any multiple any scaled version of t*** vector; it doesn't matter if you c*** t*** lambda one and t*** V one that's f*** because there's no intrinsic ordering. W*** matters is t*** you h*** the pairing correct. All right. So t*** was the two by two case. Now let's go for a three by three case. T*** one is a little bit m*** challenging and I h*** to admit. So I first c*** up w*** these numbers and t*** I started computing the eigendecomposition. Now I h*** to admit t*** I got stuck on one of the eigenvectors. I couldn't quite figure it out on my own. So I u*** Matlab to compute t*** eigenvector. So w*** I encourage you to do is f*** all three eigenvalues by h*** and I think it w*** be pretty obvious w*** you start working through it which is the difficult eigenvalue. So t*** w*** you should do by h*** is f*** two of the eigenvectors t*** you can get basically j*** by k*** of eyeballing and making s*** educated guesses. And t*** the third eigenvector you can use a computer to solve or you can j*** w*** and watch me c*** up w*** a solution. All right. So again we start by shifting t*** matrix by minus lambda setting the determinant equal to z*** and t*** proceeding to compute the determinant of t*** equation and altogether t*** gives us the characteristic equation of t*** matrix. Now t*** is a little bit longer. I*** a little bit trickier the arithmetic g*** a little bit hairy in particular you end up w*** t*** minus lambda cubed t*** as w*** as a couple of multiple terms w*** Lambda and Lambda squared. Now o*** you collect all of these l*** terms you'll end up w*** an expression t*** looks l*** this. So it should be minus lambda cubed p*** 10 times lambda squared p*** eleven lambda equals z*** Now something interesting has happened h*** all of these terms h*** a lambda attached to t*** which means t*** we can t*** a lambda out of e*** of these terms and rewrite t*** expression as minus lambda times. All of t*** stuff and immediately t*** tells us t*** lambda equals z*** is a solution. So w*** you set t*** lambda to be z*** it doesn't actually matter what's inside t*** parenthetical statement that's immediately going to set to m*** t*** equation true. T*** means t*** one of the eigenvalues of t*** matrix is z*** and I'm going to h*** an entire video j*** about t*** phenomenon a little bit later in t*** section. But essentially w*** an eigenvector is an eigenvalue is zero. It means t*** the matrix is singular and t*** you can actually see by looking at t*** matrix and you see t*** column 1 p*** column 2 equals column 3 so whenever you h*** a singular matrix at least one eigenvalues value is going to be equal to zero. And in f*** the number of eigenvalues t*** are equal to z*** tells you about the r*** of t*** matrix. M*** on t*** in the later video. Now o*** you've gotten to t*** s*** you can further factor t*** equation and you end up w*** the result t*** lambda equals z*** lambda equals minus 1 and Lambda equals eleven. So you can probably guess t*** t*** is going to be the tricky I can value to compute the corresponding I can vector of and t*** is the one t*** I got a little bit stuck with. And so I u*** Matlab as a crutch. I cheated a little bit. OK so but let's go through all of these. So we start w*** z*** and now t*** is k*** of a funny thing because we are shifting the matrix by z*** which actually means we're not changing the matrix at all. And t*** means t*** t*** matrix A already has a non-trivial n*** space e*** without doing any shifting. So t*** problem actually boils d*** to finding a vector in the n*** space or a basis for the n*** space. E*** without doing any shifting so based on w*** I j*** t*** you about how do I set up t*** matrix t*** column one p*** column two equals column three a basis for the n*** space is 1 one minus 1. So you can try for e*** of these r*** the first column p*** the second column minus the third column equals z*** all right. So now let's m*** on. So now we shift t*** matrix by eleven and t*** is basically where I got stuck and switch to matlab. So it turns out t*** eigenvector is nineteen forty one and thirty six. So if you figured out t*** I can vector on y*** own without using a computer t*** g*** for you you are a better or at least m*** patient mathematician t*** I am. And t*** we get to the third eigenvalue which was minus one. So now t*** becomes p*** one. And h*** is t*** shifted matrix and t*** one you should be a*** to solve on y*** own. In f*** i*** e*** easier t*** it looks. And if you n*** a h*** before I s*** the answer t*** the h*** is j*** consider t*** t*** third column is actually pretty useless if you get rid of t*** third column it becomes really e*** to f*** the eigenvector in t*** shifted matrices n*** space. So in f*** i*** one minus one and t*** z*** you j*** set the third element to be zero. So t*** leads us to the big picture overview of the eigendecomposition of t*** three by three singular matrix r*** 2 matrix we h*** eigenvalues 0 minus 11 and minus 1. And these are the corresponding eigenvectors. And notice I*** written t*** as row vectors and t*** transpose. So these are still column vectors we generally always think about eigenvectors as column vectors and you w*** learn m*** about why t*** is the c*** in the video on diagonalization, which is coming up soon.\""
